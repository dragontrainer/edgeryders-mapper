// The files in this folder have been extracted by the database of the online platform Edgeryders (http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int). There are two subfolders.
// "Network data" contains two files that can be imported into network analysis programs to generate networks.
// Nodes in the network represent users; edges represent comments. An edge from Alice to Bob is created if Alice comments a post by Bob or if Alice comments a comment by Bob. Edges are directed.
// The extraction was performed on December 5th 2012. The files in the folder represent a "snapshot" of the Edgeryders network at that data. Edge duration is assumed to be infinity. 
// The file is readable by main network analysis software packages: Pajek, Gephi end Tulip. 
// The extraction was made using the code in http://https://github.com/dragontrainer/edgeryders-mapper by Luca Mearelli as part of the Dragon Trainer project. You are very welcome to collaborate to the project: for an introduction, see http://www.cottica.net/?p=4711
// "Topic data" contains four files that associate the class of the modularity-maximizing partition class of the Edgeryders network (generated from the data in the "Network data" folder) of the authors and recipient of each comment to the topic of the comment itself.

// "Panel data" is a backup of a work in progress.
// "Object data" stores three .csv files that contain the essential information extracted from the raw data. userlist.csv contains data on anonymized users. Non-active users of Edgeryders have been discarded. The names of the variables are self-explanatory except "team", a boolean that has value 1 if the user is a member of the Edgeryders team and 0 otherwise. postslist.csv contains essential information about posts. Variable names are self-explanatory except "brief_id" (a subtopic) and "effort" (the length in characters of the post). commentslist contains essential info about comments. Variable names as above.
